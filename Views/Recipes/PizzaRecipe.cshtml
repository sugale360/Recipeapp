<h3>Method</h3>
<p><br />
<h4>STEP 1</h4><br />
Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm
water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a
lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the
dough to rise if you like, but it is not essential for a thin crust.
<br /><br />
<h4>STEP 2</h4>
Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room
temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
<br>
<br />
<h4>STEP 3</h4>
Roll out the dough: if youâ€™ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured
surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very
thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
<br /><br>
<h4>STEP 4</h4>
Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven
on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with
olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10
mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
